In my schema I have the parameters hardcoded
Writer is the communication to the outside world:
 it is responsible for setting bottom-up parameters distance_to_object, rmin, rmax, alpha, beta
 to the blackboard.
 These parameters are read from an independent json string
Once the parameters are set in the blackboard, ParamAndState reads these and set an emphasis value
for each task node:
  - ParamAndState needs to know from which object is the distance calculated - it reads it from blackboard
  - It sets a simple emphasis value in the blackboard/json string (?) -> blackboard
        - namespace parameters/emphasis/emphasis_node
Task planner expands the tree corresponding to the emphasis value:
- it needs to read the emphasis for each node: read it from json string or from blackboard?
    - difference computation access? probably from blackboard is quicker
        - in case it is loaded from blackboard: ParamState sets emphasis_node blackboard variable in an emphasis list
        - in case it is loaded from json string: ParamStates loads json schema, checks emphasis and writes it to the blackboard
- it needs to select the highest emphasis
which kind of emphasis?
- emphasis/nodes
- in each tick, you call Writer and ParamAndState. ParamAndState sets the highest emphasis
- in each tick, you create a behavior tree for prepare coffee task
- task planner:
    - you need to load selector_water/coffee/spoon depending on emphasis
    - what happens with the post-condition?
        - check post-condition in blackboard
